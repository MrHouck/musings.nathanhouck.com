René Descartes is known as the father of modern philosophy. His method of **radical doubt** led him to question everything that could possibly be false — until he arrived at one certainty:  
> _Cogito, ergo sum_ — “I think, therefore I am.”

Descartes believed that reason, not the senses, is the path to true knowledge. This marked a shift from relying on tradition or the Church, laying the groundwork for rationalism and modern science.

One of the hardest parts about succeeding in higher education is *learning how to study effectively*. Through high school, most student don't develop proper study habits, and I am not innocent of this fact. Entering my freshman year of college, I was not prepared for the workload. However, over the course of the past two years, I have developed a foolproof studying strategy that has allowed me to excel in my challenging classes. 

# Mind Palaces
Often on my exams I must memorize formulas or long problem-solving processes. One of the techniques I use for memorization is 
the **method of loci**, also called **mind palaces.** Cicero outlines the general method in *De Oratore*,
> "One must employ a large number of localities which must be clear and defined and at moderate intervals apart, and 
images that are effective and sharply outlined and distinctive, with the capacity of encountering and speedily penetrating the mind"
(Book II, Section 358)

Put in more understandable terms, the method of loci involves associating things you want to remember with specific places or 
images in an imagined space. **It's best to use a space you are familiar with,** because it'd be pretty hard to remember the 
layout of an unfamiliar space and everything else you want to remember. 

Another tip is to **make the assocations outlandish 
on purpose.** Think about a funny mneumonic you've used before, like PEMDAS. I remember it as Please Excuse My Dear
 Aunt Sally. This makes no sense, but the humor associated with it makes it stand out much more in my memory. Think about 
 how many funny moments you remember with your friends and family, and then try to remember a normal conversation you had last week.
 Which one do you remember more? 

Let's run through an example. I'm going to go grocery shopping, and I want to remember this grocery list:
- Bananas
- Strawberries
- Bread
- Milk
- Cheese

I'm going to use my apartment as a familiar space. So I imagine I'm starting in my bedroom. I wake up in the morning to go to the 
bathroom, and my toilet has milk instead of water in it. Afterwards I go to wash my hands, and leave my room. As I leave my room, 
I slip on a banana peel, but land on a soft cushion of bread in my hallway. Clearly having a rough morning, I go to make some 
coffee just to find that my coffee pot has been replaced by a huge block of cheese. Sighing, I grab my backpack and get ready 
to go to class. I pick up my skateboard, and all the wheels have been replaced by strawberries! 

This story sounds ridiculous, but it really works. Replace things like grocery lists with formulas and techniques--or in Cicero's 
case, key points in speeches--this method works very well.

I challenge you to do something similar, and try to remember this list:
- Stapler
- Cactus
- Pickles
- Snow Globe
- Flashlight
- Chessboard

Create a mind palace and by the end of this post see if you can still remember this list.

The applications of mind palaces may seem limited, but with proper usage can help with memorizing names, learn foreign languages,
 new vocabulary, trivia, and so on.

# The Feynman Technique

The Feynman Technique, created by famous physicist Richard Feynman, is one of the techniques I use the most when really trying to
learn and understand a topic. There are four major steps in the Feynman technique:
1. **Write** down the subject you are trying to learn, and then write everything you know about it on the page.
2. **Explain** it in your own words as if you were trying to teach it to somebody else.
3. **Review** what you got wrong and refer to your notes or material to find the correct answer.
4. **Practice** teaching it to someone else, a friend, family member, anyone. **Do not use your notes.**

One of my most recent applications of this method was when I had to learn Laplace transforms for my differential equations class.
Given a basic differential equation:


Given the differential equation: $$\quad y'' + 3y' + 2y = f(t), \quad y(0) = y_0, \, y'(0) = y_1$$

We apply the Laplace Transform to both sides using known transform rules:

$$\mathcal{L}\{y(t)\} = Y(s)$$

$$\mathcal{L}\{y'(t)\} = sY(s) - y(0)$$

$$\mathcal{L}\{y''(t)\} = s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)$$

After transforming, we get an algebraic equation in terms of Y(s), solve for Y(s), then take the inverse Laplace transform to find 
Y(t).

Now **explain** it to a child:
> "Imagine trying to understand how a car moves, but it's bouncing around because of bumps on the road. It's hard to describe the motion directly. So instead, you use a Laplace Transform â€” it's like putting on magical glasses that turn the crazy, bumpy ride into a straight road where everything is smooth. Once you solve the algebra, you take the glasses off and you're back to the real world, now holding the answer for how the car moves."

Now **review**:

Q: Why do we transform derivates?

A: In the s-domain, derivates become multiplication by *s*, making it a simple algebra problem.


Q: How do we go back to the time domain?

A: Use the inverse Laplace transform.

Now **practice!** For me, practicing was writing this very post, but for you, you could explain it to a friend, teacher, or relative.

# Pomodoro
If you've *ever* studied before, you've most likely heard of the **Pomodoro Technique.** The basic steps are:
1. Choose a topic to study
2. Set a 25 minute timer
3. Work on the task until the timer goes off.
4. Take a short break, maximum 5 minutes.
5. After 4 cycles, take a longer break, ~20-30 minutes.

Each cycle is called a *pomodoro*. When I use this technique, I make sure to set aside some time in each pomodoro to write down what 
I need to review for the next one, and recap what I worked on. 

The pomodoro technique is quite simple, but this is what makes it beautiful. When utilizing the pomdoro technique, I use tools like
[pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io). It has a timer for the pomodoro, the short break, and the long break. It also allows you to configure
the intervals, and has integration with tools like [todoist](https://todoist.com).

# Conclusion

These 3 study and memory techniques have helped me not only in class, but in everyday life. Studying is just one example of a task that
needs to be broken down into smaller pieces. The application of these tools extend beyond the academic world, and the only limit (especially for mind palaces),
is your imagination!
